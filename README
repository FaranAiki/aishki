`aishki` is a compilation of shell script used
by me to integrate nih, shells, and others to be a 
good united "Desktop Environment"

and I use this often in my daily desktop

List of config available:
	.zshrc
	.bashrc
	.vim

List of tools available:
	mkdesk
		to create a [Desktop Entry] for `rofi -show drun`

	miplay
		to download youtube music from... YouTube
		use Rhythmbox as the first opener

	emoji-selector
		the implementation is very similar as Luke's 
		emoji-selector (instead of unicode, this focuses on emoji)

To install in to the system, type:
	./install [COMMAND]
	# ./install all    -> will install config, tools, ...
	# ./install tools  -> will only install tools
	# ./install config -> will only install config [asks if the user really want to replace it]
	# ./install data   -> will only install the data
	# ./install echo 3 -> will give error because 3 is not a command
	
	for example
		./install config data
		./install tools

	or, if you use aishki's .zshrc, just type
		> ins
